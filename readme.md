# Button loading animation
This code will show animation effect when someone click on a form submit button.
The workfow is very simple:
    You will need to add (inputField) class to each input field so that if a input field is empty then the animation will not start.
    And copy and paste the whole <button></button> from this code, so that you will not need to write from scratch.

    As I have commented the 'form' opening and closing tag, hence the required attribute used for input field will not work properly. So to show an error I have putted an alert message in the script.js file, you can remove that alert message, when you wrap input fields in a form tag.
    
Good luck.
